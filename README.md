# gdrive_notability_sortering

DESCRIPTION
---
This is a python script that has for puprose to order in a more logical way the file and folder created by the Notability app in google drive.



Details
---
The source folder is the folder created by Notability wich has a flat folder hierarchy:

```
-Notability
----section_name
-------note/pdf_name
```
The section/source_sub_folder names must follow these naming rules. 

```
upper_name.middle_name.lower_name
```

e.g.: Q2.Analyse.Exercices

PS: The names of the folders created in google drives depends of the names given to the sections in the Notability app

The script rearange the folder hierarchy as shown below
```
-output_folder
----Q2
-------Analyse
----------Exercices
-------------PDF
-------------Note
```
The .pdf and .note files are separated in two sub folders

The script is really not optimized and was first designed only for personnal purpose. 
With more than a 100 files it can take several minutes to achieve.

Be patient :-)
